    "Missing values in a dataset refer to the absence of data in one or more variables for some observations.

This is because most machine learning algorithms are designed to optimize overall accuracy or error rate, and in an imbalanced dataset, this can lead to a bias towards the majority class. For example, if a dataset has 90% observations in the majority class and only 10% in the minority class, a model that always predicts the majority class would achieve an accuracy of 90%, even though it is not actually predicting the minority class correctly.\n",

In an imbalanced dataset, the number of observations in one class is significantly higher or lower than the other. Up-sampling involves creating more observations in the minority class to balance the distribution, while down-sampling involves reducing the number of observations in the majority class. For example, in fraud detection, there may be only a few fraudulent transactions compared to a large number of legitimate transactions. In this case, up-sampling can be used to create more fraudulent transactions and balance the dataset. Similarly, in cancer diagnosis, there may be a lot of healthy samples compared to cancerous samples. Here, down-sampling can be used to reduce the number of healthy samples and balance the dataset."
